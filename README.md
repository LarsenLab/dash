# DaSH10 Glasgow

A two-day hackathon will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, the Friday and Saturday just before EFI 2020. The meeting will run all day on Friday 24th and Saturday 25th of April, 2020. This will allow people to attend the opening ceremony of the 34th European Immunogenetics and Histocompatibility Conference annual meeting at 5:30pm, or any other meetings planned on Sunday.
People will hack on data standards to transfer HLA and KIR data, and create code to transfer, transform, annotate and report this data. As it is a hackathon, everyone is welcome to come and work on their own topic in a room of like-minded people. There have been nine previous DaSH events across America and Europe.
Likely topics that will get worked on include
* Development of Gene Feature Enumeration (GFE) tools
* Development of PHYCuS (Public Haplotype frequencY Curation Service) which can be found at https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/phycus
* HL7-FHIR to:
  - allow reporting of GL strings (https://glstring.org/) 
   - facilitate conversion of HML into FHIR
   - Updating the GL Service
