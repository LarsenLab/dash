# DaSH10 VIRTUAL - Data Standards for HLA 

A two-day hackathon will be held in cyberspace. The event will start at 0700 US Pacific Time Thursday 23rd and go for 48 hours ending at 0700 US Pacific time on Saturday 25th of April, 2020. This will allow people to attend from various parts of the globe and join as they are able.

People will hack on data standards to transfer HLA and KIR data, and create code to transfer, transform, annotate and report this data. 

This hackathon will focus on three topics:
* The development of a database of HLA and COVID-19 data to support global efforts in this area [HLACOVID19.org](http://hlacovid19.org)
* The development of database tools for the [18th IHIW] (http://www.ihiw18.org)
* The development of tools for validating and processing HLA genotyping results in [HML 1.0.1] (http://schemas.nmdp.org) format

There have been nine previous DaSH events across America and Europe.
